1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.390
Zsolt: Bong.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.499
Zsolt: and first of all, and on Saturday

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.180
Zsolt: I was here.

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.000
Zsolt: and some of you were here as well.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.129
Zsolt: But

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.490
Zsolt: Communication was not that obvious.

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.420
Zsolt: I guess.

8
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.059
Zsolt: Now, in theory there is class every Wednesday, every Saturday.

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.080
Zsolt: unless

10
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.960
Zsolt: someone explicitly tells me that I shouldn't show up.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.980
Zsolt: And this

12
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.190
Zsolt: didn't happen.

13
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.669
Zsolt: Now in your case, what's happening is that you have some some inbox or some cohort

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:51.250
Zsolt: dashboard and the dashboard. It doesn't schedule the class for some reason that as it that is still unknown to me, I asked the customer support. Look into it.

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.430
Zsolt: and they all they said was that they corrected it on some level.

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.809
Zsolt: and I'm fine with the corrections. That's a temporary measure. But I still don't know how this could could happen

17
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.120
Zsolt: that.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.980
Zsolt: that the notification is off. Sometimes not. Sometimes these things are, gonna be off.

19
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.500
Zsolt: But I'm here the usual times

20
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.870
Zsolt: 6 PM.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.410
Zsolt: Texas time.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.590
Zsolt: CST. Or whatever that is, or CEST. I don't know.

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.410
Zsolt: depending on whether it's summer or winter

24
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.530
Zsolt: on Wednesdays, and I think it's 10 Am. On Saturdays. But if I'm mistaken, and there are the slides. All I know is that I have to be there at 4 Pm. My time.

25
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.239
Zsolt: It's 10 Am. Your time.

26
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.069
Zsolt: which is, gonna be different like 5 pm. Soon, because I'll have the daylight saving on like this week up.

27
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.609
Zsolt: Now, this is one thing.

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.319
Zsolt: Now, the next thing is that I was thinking a bit ahead, because, you know, some people have to think ahead as well, not just not just react to what happened.

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.790
Zsolt: And the

30
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.669
Zsolt: if I'm not mistaken, you're gonna have Easter quite soon. Let's see.

31
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.680
Zsolt: Yeah. March 30. First, yeah.

32
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.529
Zsolt: Because you know, I always have problems with Easter, because, though.

33
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.900
Zsolt: like

34
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.100
Zsolt: when I celebrate well, I don't celebrate Easter in general. But then I should normally celebrate. Easter

35
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.239
Zsolt: is now, march for 30 first, and you know, that's Sunday and April first Monday.

36
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.099
Zsolt: Oh, yeah.

37
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:45.689
Zsolt: And in some other places. That's the orthodox, you know, they have, like, sometime in may. They have Easter in May like same, but they have Christmas in January as well. So so it's it's like different. But at least we have the same like calendar, same Easter.

38
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.029
Zsolt: Now, this doesn't affect the Saturday session, and this doesn't affect them

39
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.610
Zsolt: Wednesday session, either. So I'll be here on Saturday. That's actually a not exactly a business day for us in Germany, but the shops are open.

40
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.039
Zsolt: So it's there is gonna be like, there are, gonna be continuous sessions.

41
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:17.530
Zsolt: Okay, I'll mark attendance. And in the meantime, please collect your questions either type them in the chat or unmute yourselves while I'm marking attendance.

42
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.280
Zsolt: And

43
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.519
Zsolt: also, if you need screen sharing, then please prepare that

44
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.360
Zsolt: sewn.

45
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:40.649
Zsolt: And, by the way, we had had a short session on Wednesday, no, not Wednesday on Saturday. And this session is, gonna be short. And with like that amount you can reverse the recording. We were solving some problems back then.

46
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.880
Zsolt: So

47
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.799
Zsolt: it's gonna be, I think, one and a half hours or so approximately

48
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.940
Zsolt: so. I'm working attendance.

49
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.850
Zsolt: Soul

50
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.130
Zsolt: session to end

51
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.120
Zsolt: today is March

52
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.660
Zsolt: only solved.

53
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.239
Zsolt: This is good news for some of you, because you can catch up

54
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.539
Zsolt: because the march 20 third session and today's session together is gonna make up week week, 2 session.

55
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.680
Zsolt: The boot can be perfectly length on the bike.

56
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.339
Zsolt: like one session.

57
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.520
Zsolt: I'll click

58
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.760
Zsolt: done.

59
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.870
Zsolt: Oh.

60
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.720
Zsolt: then, let me see the chat. The chat is still empty, so this means that everything is fine. You have more questions, I guess.

61
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.370
Zsolt: So what I'm gonna do then

62
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.429
Zsolt: is

63
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.289
Zsolt: soon start sharing my screen.

64
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.669
Zsolt: I'll move the attendance sheet to the other computer. Yeah.

65
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.140
Zsolt: not other computer, other screen.

66
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.640
Zsolt: The.

67
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.030
Zsolt: let me see.

68
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.519
Zsolt: Google is on

69
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.860
Zsolt: and sharing my screen

70
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.369
Zsolt: at least the first 3 out of 2.

71
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.850
Zsolt: And here

72
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.120
Zsolt: and visual studio code.

73
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.160
Zsolt: a visual studio code.

74
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.260
Zsolt: Yeah, that's

75
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.230
Zsolt: something we can close

76
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.560
Zsolt: roots.

77
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.159
Zsolt: HDMI, Css. Webinar.

78
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.450
Zsolt: it's different.

79
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.669
Zsolt: That's October node.

80
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.530
Zsolt: That's something we can close. That's the February cohort.

81
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.289
Zsolt: What else do we have? That's it. March? HTML, css.

82
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.940
Zsolt: so we got started with the invas at the HTML,

83
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.369
Zsolt: we have wireframes.

84
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.740
Zsolt: We have the indesert. HTML, we have user stories.

85
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.610
Zsolt: So that's where we left off. I guess

86
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.800
Zsolt: I stop screen sharing for a moment, because I need to get the document then.

87
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.579
Zsolt: But for some reason it's not letting me stop

88
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.340
Zsolt: the screen now. It's fine

89
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.420
Zsolt: goods.

90
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.720
Zsolt: Bum

91
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.760
Zsolt: drives of google.com

92
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.070
Zsolt: though

93
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.239
Zsolt: the HDMI Css notes

94
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.030
Zsolt: and also Github.

95
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.829
Zsolt: So we did user stories. We did wire frames already.

96
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.120
Zsolt: It's also on Github.

97
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.559
Zsolt: Now I can share my screen one.

98
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.239
Zsolt: and we understood the bit workflow

99
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.630
Zsolt: github pages hosting. We practice this extensively with like multiple accounts.

100
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.659
Zsolt: We did user stories. We did wireframes.

101
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.980
Zsolt: and we started the basic HDMI. Now today.

102
00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.579
Zsolt: Continue with building

103
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.299
Zsolt: at least the HTML, but also more like Css. And other things as well.

104
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.239
Zsolt: So that's what's coming today

105
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.550
Zsolt: and well, regarding HTML, Css. And everything else.

106
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:28.359
Zsolt: you will need some practice as well. So there are some courses for that.

107
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.100
Zsolt: And you will need to use some of those horses, obviously

108
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.799
Zsolt: make some progress.

109
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.530
Zsolt: Okay.

110
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.710
Zsolt: now.

111
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.250
Zsolt: HTML,

112
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:45.740
Zsolt: so HDMI stands for hypertext markup language. That's something you've heard of.

113
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.610
Zsolt: The.

114
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.140
Zsolt: it's. It basically gives you the structure of a document.

115
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.420
Zsolt: What does it mean that it's it's a structure of a document. Well.

116
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:12.920
Zsolt: there is obviously structure that you define. Like. For example, in this document, specifically, we have a title. We have paragraphs we have, like some growth text and some other things as well. There's a structure styling is something else.

117
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.710
Zsolt: So when it comes to styling.

118
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.669
Zsolt: you have an other

119
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.600
Zsolt: type of

120
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.090
Zsolt: type of language that is called Css. Css. Is like a

121
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.750
Zsolt: cascading style sheets. You will learn that possibly next time.

122
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.810
Zsolt: and when it comes to dynamic behavior it's Javascript.

123
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.190
Zsolt: So HTML. Css. And Javascript. These, these are the main topics that would.

124
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.859
Zsolt: That's we deal with that we learn.

125
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.429
Zsolt: Okay, I'll move the chat to the second screen, just so that

126
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.620
Zsolt: so that it's available.

127
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:59.600
Zsolt: Okay, now, in case of a document you've you've seen, you've seen the platform like title, body and so on.

128
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.869
Zsolt: We will clean the body.

129
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.350
Zsolt: and we'll build the do the document from the ground up.

130
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:13.919
Zsolt: Everything starts with structure. So an HTML document usually has a header

131
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.750
Zsolt: don't

132
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.250
Zsolt: confuse header with head. They are different. This is header.

133
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.519
Zsolt: They have one main section.

134
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.810
Zsolt: and they have a full dirt

135
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.269
Zsolt: on top level. This is typical. It's not mandatory. It's just typical.

136
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:42.629
Zsolt: What's important is that you can only have one main section in the document. But you can have multiple headers, multiple footers, because there can be sections inside of the document

137
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.980
Zsolt: that can have headers or footers, for that matter.

138
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.169
Zsolt: So so far, that's what we did.

139
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.220
Zsolt: And then

140
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.820
Zsolt: I'll

141
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.750
Zsolt: create some

142
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.710
Zsolt: content inside the header.

143
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.750
Zsolt: I'll make this a bit larger. Yeah.

144
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.380
Zsolt: By the way, development tip control A and the letter Z gives you zen mode.

145
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.129
Zsolt: And then you see everything full screen

146
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:21.930
Zsolt: and we double escape. You get out of it. So control K and ZI think I use this for demonstration purposes. Otherwise I would have problems with my quote formative.

147
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.729
Zsolt: Another issue is that in my specific situation

148
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.700
Zsolt: and the paragraph, for example, like.

149
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.159
Zsolt: you know what I just write Lauren 25.

150
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:43.199
Zsolt: This gives you 2025 verse of paramet. So you see that the code auto formats it, or the visual studio could auto formats it in my case, because I have the

151
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:52.679
Zsolt: prettier auto formatter. But my ruler is a hundred 20 characters, long 120. That's a lot.

152
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.740
Zsolt: and as I. Co. If I copy, paste this to your document, you will not like it.

153
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.100
Zsolt: So for this reason

154
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.630
Zsolt: I'll do a double escape.

155
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.180
Zsolt: But

156
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.449
Zsolt: and I go to my extensions

157
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.390
Zsolt: and search for prettier.

158
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.889
Zsolt: That's a prettier code format, or there it is.

159
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.210
Zsolt: This is what I installed.

160
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.840
Zsolt: and so

161
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.920
Zsolt: them

162
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.330
Zsolt: inside prettier

163
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.460
Zsolt: close. Everything else inside prettier, you might have some settings.

164
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.239
Zsolt: Seems like it's an adjacent file.

165
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.700
Zsolt: Soap.

166
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.639
Zsolt: configuration, prettier configuration files.

167
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.209
Zsolt: Open the prettier configuration file.

168
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.189
Zsolt: Actually, that's not what I wanted.

169
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.759
Zsolt: You can use via scope settings to configure prettier.

170
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.690
Zsolt: So visual studio code settings.

171
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.980
Zsolt: This is where we do the configuration

172
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.490
Zsolt: usage.

173
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.169
Zsolt: Command control, shift, P.

174
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.760
Zsolt: No

175
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.810
Zsolt: keep, or short or snow

176
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.100
Zsolt: editor dot format on, save yes.

177
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.020
Zsolt: I just need to see where the configuration file is.

178
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.280
Zsolt: because there is a default configuration file for Visual studio group.

179
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.390
Zsolt: I pasted this visual studio called Settings, or maybe just settings.

180
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.980
Zsolt: But I can also go to the file.

181
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.739
Zsolt: And where is it settings, preferences.

182
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.569
Zsolt: profile settings. There you go. This is settings.

183
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.545
Zsolt: And

184
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.829
Zsolt: text editor is windows, features?

185
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.850
Zsolt: No, not features

186
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.929
Zsolt: security, no extensions. There you go extensions. That's what we need.

187
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.095
Zsolt: and

188
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.809
Zsolt: prettier is one of them.

189
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.010
Zsolt: and inside, pretor we have some settings, that's what I was looking for.

190
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.640
Zsolt: and

191
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.500
Zsolt: bracket spacing no config config, but no

192
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.900
Zsolt: enable and offline.

193
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.050
Zsolt: HTML. Rights-based sensitivity.

194
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.669
Zsolt: Strict white spaces are considered considered sensitive.

195
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.640
Zsolt: I think I use this one this option because this will help us.

196
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.380
Zsolt: So let's go back.

197
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.980
Zsolt: Strict is, gonna be the way to go.

198
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.120
Zsolt: Then you have pretty or ignore.

199
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:37.179
Zsolt: because if I put some enters in a text. Then they just delete the enter the prettier formatting

200
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.490
Zsolt: water props as needed.

201
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.370
Zsolt: Progma semi

202
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.289
Zsolt: have with these 4 characters. That's important.

203
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.870
Zsolt: hey?

204
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:08.129
Zsolt: Not projects, not violence. You see, there are so many settings, prettier maintenance at at so much time

205
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.360
Zsolt: or so much effort put into it

206
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.610
Zsolt: some python specifics.

207
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.510
Zsolt: simple browser also. What is this? No.

208
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.150
Zsolt: 9.

209
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.290
Zsolt: And so

210
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.550
Zsolt: and this is the format on, save.

211
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.290
Zsolt: So this is what I had to check myself.

212
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.130
Zsolt: So, editor, not format on, save.

213
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.500
Zsolt: So this is already something, because we have quite a lot of settings.

214
00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:09.300
Zsolt: And same happens for like workspace settings, user settings, workspace settings.

215
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.420
Zsolt: So

216
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:22.069
Zsolt: you see, this is how this is, how you see what can be configured for pretor

217
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:29.200
Zsolt: even of editor phone size, tab size, and so on. This is like a common

218
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.880
Zsolt: configuration.

219
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.669
Zsolt: I'm just looking for something called a ruler.

220
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.909
Zsolt: So let's see if I can find the ruler.

221
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.750
Zsolt: No?

222
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.910
Zsolt: Then you know what

223
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.480
Zsolt: we go to chat. But openai.com.

224
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.530
Zsolt: How can I change?

225
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.539
Zsolt: The rulers are prettier

226
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.609
Zsolt: and visual studio code.

227
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.700
Zsolt: prettier dot print with

228
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.690
Zsolt: prettier dot print, with static

229
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:17.060
Zsolt: open visual studio code file preferences, settings. Yeah, that's where we were

230
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.560
Zsolt: in the settings. But type print with.

231
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.560
Zsolt: that's where we were actually

232
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.399
Zsolt: so settings. But

233
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.530
Zsolt: file

234
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.069
Zsolt: preferences settings.

235
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.399
Zsolt: There you go and print that.

236
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.579
Zsolt: and it says, 120. That's what I wanted to change to. 80

237
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.770
Zsolt: and press enter.

238
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.139
Zsolt: And I think we're done.

239
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.749
Zsolt: So you go back to the Indexation channel and save. And you see now it's 80

240
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.379
Zsolt: 80 characters, which means that this ruler is now respected.

241
00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:02.959
Zsolt: So you see, this is how you find the information. I had no idea how to how to change this setting. I just knew that it's some very visual studio code

242
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.430
Zsolt: and actually chat, Gpt managed to guide me to the correct place.

243
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.660
Zsolt: If you have a similar configuration problem.

244
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.629
Zsolt: you'll be able to solve this problem as well.

245
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.799
Zsolt: For example, how can I add? A second ruler?

246
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.840
Zsolt: And visuals will be opened.

247
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.030
Zsolt: and then

248
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.159
Zsolt: January and January 2022 didn't support multiple users.

249
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:41.499
Zsolt: But you can use extensions. One is the editor ruler, okay, and open it, install it, and so on. You see, it gave you some

250
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.059
Zsolt: some example, and Editor dot rulers. There you go.

251
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:53.240
Zsolt: I have the same setting, by the way, with the interduct rulers, and this is the proof that if you check.

252
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.360
Zsolt: this is my second ruler, or that was, you see.

253
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:08.090
Zsolt: But for now we're going to respect this 80 character limit, and with prettier because it's going to auto form at our code.

254
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.580
Zsolt: This comes handy because

255
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.400
Zsolt: documenting what happened.

256
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.489
Zsolt: No, we have the header. We have the main section. We have the footer.

257
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.139
Zsolt: and inside the header will add.

258
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.879
Zsolt: I had the involvement

259
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.550
Zsolt: or blush

260
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.910
Zsolt: boom.

261
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.375
Zsolt: And

262
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.280
Zsolt: we also have

263
00:20:33.547 --> 00:20:35.219
Zsolt: navigational element law.

264
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.689
Zsolt: but not slashing off.

265
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.680
Zsolt: And this navigational element is gonna have an unorder list inside.

266
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:50.020
Zsolt: So the way how you create these tags in visuals for your code. So these are called texts open, intact, close, intact.

267
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.179
Zsolt: The way how you create these stacks

268
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.049
Zsolt: is so

269
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.460
Zsolt: is time. For example, UL. Unordered list.

270
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.609
Zsolt: And then you press the tabulator key.

271
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.270
Zsolt: variable.

272
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.189
Zsolt: unordered list and tabulator.

273
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.119
Zsolt: and it generates the rest for you, and the cursor is in the in in between the ul and slash. Well.

274
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:21.479
Zsolt: and then you have list items. If you want to have 5 list items. Then you write all I times 5 and present every turkey.

275
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.199
Zsolt: There you go. It gives you 5 list items. Isn't that amazing.

276
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:35.080
Zsolt: even better. You can use parentheses, and you can see that LIA greater than sign which acts as a right arrow and a

277
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.120
Zsolt: as in anchor

278
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.359
Zsolt: and death. Times 12.

279
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.739
Zsolt: You can do all these things, these expressions.

280
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.560
Zsolt: or Emmett abbreviation. So this is called Emmett.

281
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.220
Zsolt: and it it does the following

282
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:57.419
Zsolt: create list items and anchors inside them, and multiply them by 5, which means I do it 5 times

283
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.860
Zsolt: variable.

284
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.080
Zsolt: bought

285
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.020
Zsolt: the Href attribute of the anchor, which is like the link it points to

286
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.860
Zsolt: is not supplied.

287
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.999
Zsolt: So if you wanted to, you can add this in brackets.

288
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.370
Zsolt: H. Rough equals

289
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.540
Zsolt: Peshmark.

290
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.810
Zsolt: and if you generate this.

291
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.069
Zsolt: We have 5 of these items. I guess if some of you have learned the HTML already.

292
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:37.109
Zsolt: you know most people don't don't tend to show you these things. They they will open a notepad and start start writing HDMI in there

293
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.930
Zsolt: and do everything manually.

294
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.090
Zsolt: Now the problem with doing everything manually

295
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.510
Zsolt: is that it's quite errable

296
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.330
Zsolt: because oftentimes you don't know.

297
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.590
Zsolt: Booked

298
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.849
Zsolt: is proper. HTML, what is not.

299
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.930
Zsolt: Now in the document. The first

300
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.329
Zsolt: link was a dot, which means there is a current folder.

301
00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.139
Zsolt: And then I need to add this, like home phones, features to actual contact.

302
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.210
Zsolt: home

303
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.080
Zsolt: wolves.

304
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.020
Zsolt: features.

305
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.210
Zsolt: workshop.

306
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.710
Zsolt: and contact.

307
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.940
Zsolt: So

308
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.890
Zsolt: if you check this out we have a header

309
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:31.030
Zsolt: that has a main title, heading one. So this is header, and this is heading.

310
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.280
Zsolt: each one having one. There can only be one heading one in the document.

311
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.679
Zsolt: Then next to it, you have a navigational element.

312
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.130
Zsolt: and inside the navigation element you have an unordered list.

313
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.330
Zsolt: and then you have list items and anchors inside.

314
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:54.610
Zsolt: So

315
00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:00.590
Zsolt: that's in each this item you have an anchor, and that points somewhere.

316
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:08.640
Zsolt: I'll give you a 6 time course, so that you can experiment it. So hf, equals https.

317
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.420
Zsolt: google.com. Okay.

318
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.640
Zsolt: but this is a sixth timer.

319
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.369
Zsolt: And let's run the code. Just so that you see what is going on. We click on the top.

320
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.540
Zsolt: Write the con index index. HTML, open with live server.

321
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.650
Zsolt: Now you can see

322
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.220
Zsolt: but 6 menu items.

323
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.690
Zsolt: home space

324
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:47.549
Zsolt: phone features and so on. You get an extra hash mark, because that's what the link it's called. The it's called by the way as well some sort of a skip link. If we had an Id attribute.

325
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.179
Zsolt: And Google, that is Google, you know, you go to Google.

326
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:58.249
Zsolt: That's why it's called a hyperlink because you get other links that you can follow.

327
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:05.639
Zsolt: And so obviously this is just a demonstration that you can use external links as well, but I'll be needing this.

328
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.030
Zsolt: Now comes the weird situation.

329
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.290
Zsolt: namely, that

330
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.970
Zsolt: there is this

331
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.370
Zsolt: unordered list with links.

332
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.060
Zsolt: But if you're observant.

333
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.450
Zsolt: then you must kind of know.

334
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.069
Zsolt: But something is weird in here.

335
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.879
Zsolt: Here you have 5 items.

336
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.620
Zsolt: But why

337
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.779
Zsolt: lie below each other?

338
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.619
Zsolt: Why not next to each other, for instance.

339
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.509
Zsolt: they could have been like next to each other as well.

340
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.170
Zsolt: not like below each other around.

341
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.120
Zsolt: Because

342
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.119
Zsolt: if you check the original wireframe.

343
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.679
Zsolt: okay, it loads. It takes quite a while. So I just

344
00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.219
Zsolt: right click on it

345
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.375
Zsolt: and

346
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.529
Zsolt: copy that.

347
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.340
Zsolt: And after copying the path

348
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.080
Zsolt: and just paste the path in here

349
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.449
Zsolt: that also works.

350
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.740
Zsolt: So with the copy path feature, you have this option.

351
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.339
Zsolt: and there you can see that the links themselves are next to each other and not below each other.

352
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.470
Zsolt: So something is weird in here, right

353
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.949
Zsolt: that though

354
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:34.359
Zsolt: we created the proper representation of the document, and these things are now below each other, and not next to each other.

355
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:40.579
Zsolt: And you may ask, Okay, fine. But how come? This is happening? Because I expected something different.

356
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.060
Zsolt: But the answer to this

357
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.550
Zsolt: question or this problematic situation is that it's actually not a problematic situation at all.

358
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:55.770
Zsolt: Because, remember, the beginning of the session, I told you that HTML is not meant to do any styling whatsoever.

359
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.409
Zsolt: The purpose of HTML

360
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:07.990
Zsolt: is that you do the basic, not styling, but functionality related updates. Functionality

361
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.410
Zsolt: styling will come later.

362
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.860
Zsolt: Styling is another topic.

363
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.470
Zsolt: And that's the

364
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.569
Zsolt: that's the idea. So that's that's how

365
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.430
Zsolt: that's how you work

366
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.210
Zsolt: with the

367
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.120
Zsolt: HTML and Css. Separately

368
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:31.450
Zsolt: for demonstration purposes. I'm gonna show you some styling. You don't need to remember this

369
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.670
Zsolt: yet.

370
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.580
Zsolt: So it's just a demonstration that don't worry about look and feel it just really

371
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.569
Zsolt: indifferent doesn't matter.

372
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:45.020
Zsolt: So, for example, in the header you to display flax.

373
00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.140
Zsolt: now they are next to each other already, just like in the on the screen.

374
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.600
Zsolt: You have the logo, and then you have the links right?

375
00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:54.310
Zsolt: But then

376
00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.799
Zsolt: display flags. That's fine.

377
00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:02.619
Zsolt: And then inside the navigation element there is an unorder list. Yeah.

378
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.870
Zsolt: So in case of the anode of this, you say, display flags.

379
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:09.330
Zsolt: There you go. Now they are next to each other.

380
00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.630
Zsolt: Now on this

381
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.520
Zsolt: container

382
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.930
Zsolt: they are.

383
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.920
Zsolt: Let's do here, vertical or not vertical, all 9 dobs.

384
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.930
Zsolt: baseline

385
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.160
Zsolt: terrible. Now they are aligned properly, vertically.

386
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.569
Zsolt: and I happen to just know some of these things because I've been

387
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:45.770
Zsolt: doing Css. Since the late 19 nineties. Okay.

388
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:56.629
Zsolt: Flexbox is not that the also flex box is coming? Is, is there? Since 2,015 or so, but with some practice you will just not be able to forget it.

389
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.880
Zsolt: So display flags on the unordered list

390
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.060
Zsolt: and

391
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.160
Zsolt: list style

392
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.600
Zsolt: not.

393
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.869
Zsolt: And now you just have text, and these items are next to each other.

394
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:17.730
Zsolt: Now, the unfortunately, the problem is that for list items

395
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.459
Zsolt: I need to just style all these titles with some margin.

396
00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.250
Zsolt: like one audio number. Let's see, there you go.

397
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.599
Zsolt: So let's say I just add the margin right for demonstration purposes.

398
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.780
Zsolt: That's it.

399
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.959
Zsolt: If you want to increase the phone size, be my, be my guess. The phone size

400
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.820
Zsolt: like

401
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.109
Zsolt: 1.5 aria. There, you or 1.25 aria

402
00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.620
Zsolt: text operation

403
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.690
Zsolt: long.

404
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.769
Zsolt: Actually, that's not on the list item. So this doesn't work.

405
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.480
Zsolt: but rather on the anchor inside. So

406
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.819
Zsolt: I remove the text decoration from the home. Only so text decoration?

407
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.379
Zsolt: None. There you go. There is no underlining, you see.

408
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.399
Zsolt: so you can do all these things, and it's it's not even close to being hard.

409
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:31.310
Zsolt: You just need to know where to apply these rules. You'll learn all of them in the coming weeks.

410
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.310
HashemZidan: I have a question.

411
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.760
Zsolt: It's not. Yeah.

412
00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:38.239
HashemZidan: Why did you do it in the inspect element rather than visual studio code?

413
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.369
Zsolt: Because this is just some demo.

414
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.809
Zsolt: So as soon as I reload the page, everything is gone.

415
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:47.190
HashemZidan: Okay.

416
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.639
Zsolt: So this is not permanent. This is just temporary.

417
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.799
HashemZidan: Oh, okay.

418
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.610
Zsolt: What you can do is you can click on any element

419
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.839
Zsolt: and apply any styles on. For example, the annual dot list.

420
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.980
Zsolt: If you do background color

421
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.790
Zsolt: pink. There you go now. The background color is pink.

422
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.780
HashemZidan: Jordan, and that's Vanessa.

423
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:17.579
Zsolt: But as soon as you reload the page, it's gonna go back to the original. We use the visuals. You you use the developer tools.

424
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.329
Zsolt: So this inspect element, you see that you right, click, inspect.

425
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.820
Zsolt: and okay, what would it be like if the phone

426
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.000
Zsolt: Ponto

427
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.939
Zsolt: was, let's say comics.

428
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.239
Zsolt: But we have this? No, we don't.

429
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.470
Zsolt: Than the Robocall.

430
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.780
Zsolt: Do we have roboto?

431
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.479
Zsolt: No, we don't.

432
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.780
Zsolt: Then the

433
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.969
Zsolt: what else? Career?

434
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.359
Zsolt: What is this

435
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.810
Zsolt: soul?

436
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.160
Zsolt: That case so

437
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.510
Zsolt: consult us.

438
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.140
Zsolt: Invalid property value, then what kind of font do you have like font?

439
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.390
Zsolt: Maybe it's won't family leave so

440
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.850
Zsolt: form of family.

441
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.879
Zsolt: and then not icon. But let's say, roboto.

442
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.539
Zsolt: yeah. Now you have roboto. There you go. I just messed up the want. It's it's not one family, not one.

443
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:22.960
Zsolt: So

444
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.979
Zsolt: that. That's how this works.

445
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.820
Zsolt: Basically, all you need to do is just set these basic things up.

446
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:32.950
Zsolt: And the

447
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.070
Zsolt: of them.

448
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.399
Zsolt: the things are gonna

449
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.279
Zsolt: be displayed in the way how you expect them to be displayed.

450
00:32:41.866 --> 00:32:45.830
Zsolt: But then, after you finish the experimentation, you just quit.

451
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:53.540
Zsolt: and continue your work, or just copy it over to visual studio code. And then it's gonna become permanent. Right now, it's temporary.

452
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.599
Zsolt: It's not meant to be permanent, right?

453
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.550
Zsolt: Soap.

454
00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.789
Zsolt: That's what you usually do.

455
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.620
Zsolt: Okay?

456
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.790
Zsolt: Now.

457
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:14.740
Zsolt: given, this was just an experiment. And we're not gonna do styling today is just so that you're relieved that you don't exactly have to do this.

458
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.330
Zsolt: but it's

459
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.709
Zsolt: like it's, it's not not even difficult.

460
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.619
Zsolt: You won't need to change the Markov for styling.

461
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.260
Zsolt: So then we're going to continue with the main area.

462
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.969
Zsolt: because with a header we're fine with the header right?

463
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.060
Zsolt: And

464
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.909
Zsolt: by the way, when you finish developing something like the header

465
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.160
Zsolt: on the left. You see these arrows.

466
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.150
Zsolt: and you can just close the header by clicking on the arrow

467
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.239
Zsolt: next to it.

468
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:55.690
Zsolt: and then you won't be bothered by the header. And you can continue with the main area. You type section dice 5, because we're gonna have 5 sections in total.

469
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.329
Zsolt: So the main area has multiple sections.

470
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.520
Zsolt: Let's see what we have.

471
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.240
Zsolt: The first section

472
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.350
Zsolt: is gonna be a better.

473
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:08.150
Zsolt: So

474
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.509
Zsolt: I have this thing called the 8 Enrollment. Hdm, equivalent

475
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:20.019
Zsolt: in the first section. This is it. Place a background image on this section, for example.

476
00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.360
Zsolt: and then I have heading to flagship flush.

477
00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.300
Zsolt: There you go.

478
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.790
Zsolt: Why? Because the heading. One was already here.

479
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.260
Zsolt: So heading to flagship Posh.

480
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.859
Zsolt: then whatever luxury means on the innovation.

481
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.440
Zsolt: ma'am.

482
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.860
Zsolt: and then bottom

483
00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.750
Zsolt: by now

484
00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.419
Zsolt: that's just the content. We don't care about images at this stage.

485
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:04.910
Zsolt: You just care about describing the content as but as but as much as possible.

486
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.899
Zsolt: Okay. And now I got a question

487
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:17.700
Zsolt: whether I can share the curriculum link. No, I'm not going to share the curriculum link. I'm going to share the cohort for the link.

488
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:19.890
Zsolt: So

489
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.060
Zsolt: classes.

490
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.840
Zsolt: and

491
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.550
Zsolt: I'll give you the code for the link as usual.

492
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.229
Zsolt: There you go.

493
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.710
Zsolt: inside the cohort folder link.

494
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.850
Zsolt: You go to software engineering curriculum.

495
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.730
Zsolt: and we're finishing the second week because we could have started the third week. But

496
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.719
Zsolt: but on Saturday the class was not food.

497
00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.379
Zsolt: It was actually almost empty.

498
00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:02.059
Zsolt: But they'll just loosely follow the curriculum. Not exactly follow it

499
00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.270
Zsolt: loosely. Following the curriculum means

500
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.646
Zsolt: but that

501
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.160
Zsolt: for example, we started HTML a bit earlier than usual.

502
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:21.670
Zsolt: And also, we focus on projects. So I cannot tell you much about the it fundamentals itf plus. It's an overkill long course

503
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.600
Zsolt: that

504
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:33.039
Zsolt: helps. You know the fundamentals of. If you haven't turned on a computer before, like literally, not in real terms.

505
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:42.990
Zsolt: then or not literally. Then then it helps you understand what what is going on? That's the company id fundamentals. But

506
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.879
Zsolt: we just focus on practice. So it's Css, and

507
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:52.930
Zsolt: we've done ux and product management already. By the way, with the user stories and the wireframes.

508
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.270
Zsolt: those considerations are done.

509
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.110
Zsolt: So think of these things

510
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.029
Zsolt: like, it's meant to be flexible like this.

511
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.520
Zsolt: Okay?

512
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.159
Zsolt: And now back to the

513
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.870
Zsolt: application.

514
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.690
Zsolt: So you have this section

515
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.099
Zsolt: by and all.

516
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.359
Zsolt: And then you have more sections.

517
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.300
Zsolt: For example.

518
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.169
Zsolt: we'll add a couple of phones.

519
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.790
Zsolt: So inside the section.

520
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:30.590
Zsolt: the second section. So we're closing the first section inside the second section, we're going to have beefs.

521
00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:38.859
Zsolt: These are meaningless containers. Everything is a container like header, main section, everything else. They are just containers.

522
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:44.599
Zsolt: An HDMI div is a meaning glass container. It's not a section. It's not a header.

523
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.849
Zsolt: It's not well

524
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.029
Zsolt: list type of thing. It's not a paragraph, it's not a heading.

525
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.690
Zsolt: it's just to.

526
00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.480
Zsolt: It's just a box.

527
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.500
Zsolt: and

528
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.479
Zsolt: we'll add the first cliff.

529
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.819
Zsolt: So, heading to once again

530
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.560
Zsolt: black trip.

531
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.630
Zsolt: blush.

532
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.150
Zsolt: paragraph.

533
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.040
Zsolt: luxury meets innovation.

534
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.580
Zsolt: And then what else do you have

535
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.430
Zsolt: another? An image

536
00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.190
Zsolt: IMG. Sends for image.

537
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.160
Zsolt: Don't ask me why

538
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:29.360
Zsolt: everything else is written perfectly, but image has to be Img, of course, but image was already Img in the early 90 s.

539
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.589
Zsolt: And for the source of the image, we're gonna use this place for that id service.

540
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.350
Zsolt: So here it is, this place for that. It service is actually quite interesting.

541
00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.180
Zsolt: If you check it out.

542
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.899
Zsolt: you can generate so-called placeholder images.

543
00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:08.720
Zsolt: Oh, that's interesting. What about this one? Yeah. So placeholder images, you can even specify the background color, which is like light grey, and the phone color, which is black if you wanted to make it blue.

544
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.120
Zsolt: then ff.

545
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.039
Zsolt: now, now the text is booked.

546
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.150
Zsolt: And so.

547
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.860
Zsolt: for example, the opposite of blue is yellow.

548
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.190
Zsolt: So if you wanted to do

549
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:27.990
Zsolt: this.

550
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:30.480
Zsolt: then you.

551
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.410
Zsolt: your eyes are gonna be destroyed. But anyway.

552
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.609
Zsolt: so these are the cover codes.

553
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:39.470
Zsolt: Paul.

554
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.310
Zsolt: but it doesn't matter, so you can get away with the default image as well. It doesn't.

555
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:58.969
Zsolt: and 200 is a bit. The other 200 is the height. If you want to tie 400

556
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:00.080
Zsolt: variable.

557
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.249
Zsolt: So this is a service placeholder.

558
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.649
Zsolt: simple placeholder service.

559
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.669
Zsolt: Hopefully, it's not rocket science.

560
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.510
Zsolt: and the

561
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:29.180
Zsolt: you can create the placeholder dot or placehold.it service. Image yourself. The objective is that once again, we're just focusing on the markup. We're focusing on the HTML. We couldn't care less about what images there are gonna be at the end. And the and the website.

562
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:33.659
Zsolt: We just take some random image, and we just paste it here.

563
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.780
Zsolt: And then we describe

564
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.960
Zsolt: what's on the image. And this is what's on the image, the title.

565
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.190
Zsolt: and you see that when it doesn't fit, for example, now it didn't fit.

566
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.590
Zsolt: In that case we break the line

567
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.260
Zsolt: and add the attributes like formative like this.

568
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.089
Zsolt: So this image is a tag.

569
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:05.299
Zsolt: This is the first attribute of the tag, the support source, attribute. This is the odd attribute of the tag.

570
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.930
Zsolt: So these are properties of the image.

571
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.540
Zsolt: This is a key.

572
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.010
Zsolt: and

573
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.019
Zsolt: this on the right. The orange stuff is a value.

574
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.490
Zsolt: and one other thing is that image is a so-called self-closing tag.

575
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:26.420
Zsolt: You want to send that, for example, heading to as an opening tag and a closing tag, and the heading

576
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.690
Zsolt: tax itself is in between.

577
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.490
Zsolt: Now, in case of image, there is nothing in between the image

578
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:38.030
Zsolt: tags, because there is just one image tag, and if you add the slash at the end.

579
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.470
Zsolt: it just closes the tangle together.

580
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.520
Zsolt: So this is a closing tag.

581
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:56.529
Zsolt: If you have learned that you don't have to close the image tag that's absolutely valid as well in HTML is just not logical.

582
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:03.989
Zsolt: but it's valid. Many people use it like this. I tend to close it because I used to work with xhtml as well in the past.

583
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.840
Zsolt: So that's the placeholder image.

584
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:14.649
Zsolt: And then you have a paragraph 8, 99, and the bottom by now.

585
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.220
Zsolt: Groups.

586
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.590
Zsolt: So that's that's it for the first, if

587
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.259
Zsolt: and now we have a few more difs.

588
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.900
Zsolt: So second one.

589
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.560
Zsolt: Once again you have a heading, 2 lunch locks.

590
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.280
Zsolt: Luxor Lexi. Yeah. Luxembourg.

591
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.280
Zsolt: fluctuating and really fine.

592
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:54.519
Zsolt: Is it like with E or we? Just I think it's just kind of

593
00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.080
Zsolt: of

594
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:03.969
Zsolt: is this not editable or what? Oh, yeah, it's currently not editable for me, because I'm

595
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.700
Zsolt: different.

596
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.160
Zsolt: Different account. But anyway, it's it's fine.

597
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.460
Zsolt: So

598
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.929
Zsolt: we'll just use locks. And that's it.

599
00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.330
Zsolt: I'm actually redefined, redefined.

600
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:23.959
Zsolt: There you go.

601
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:32.152
Zsolt: and we'll have another image. I just copy the image over, because the only difference is the old fax and the we can just

602
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.190
Zsolt: copy the or text.

603
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.249
Zsolt: The base holder image is the same.

604
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.819
Zsolt: and then it has a price 1, 2, 9, 9,

605
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.189
Zsolt: and it has a button

606
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:49.940
Zsolt: buying off.

607
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.209
Zsolt: Let's see the end result, because

608
00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:59.350
Zsolt: it's kind of intriguing. You see that they we have the banner here.

609
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.020
Zsolt: Then we have the first phone.

610
00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:12.679
Zsolt: Then we have the second phone, and you might be thinking, Okay, that's all fine. But how is this gonna work at the end? So how, how is this gonna become some sort of a

611
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.519
Zsolt: proper website? Because this looks really weird at the moment

612
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.499
Zsolt: it's it's like

613
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.540
Zsolt: reading everything like below each other, but I showed you that it's quite easy

614
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.100
Zsolt: to do styling.

615
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.880
Zsolt: I'll show you once again.

616
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.600
Zsolt: Second section.

617
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.649
Zsolt: What if I place a display flux in here?

618
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.009
Zsolt: There you go. The 2 phones are next to each other already

619
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.150
Zsolt: I had to justify content

620
00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.090
Zsolt: space.

621
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:43.889
Zsolt: You need one of these.

622
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.979
Zsolt: There you go.

623
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.680
Zsolt: So the space is spaced, Eve. Only now.

624
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.170
Zsolt: So you have all these options.

625
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.390
Zsolt: So problem solved.

626
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.050
Zsolt: Some

627
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.060
Zsolt: tourists, it seems like they discovered the seats next to our

628
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.319
Zsolt: apartment at the studio at the same time

629
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:30.809
Zsolt: I usually call the police on them, but now we have crested, so I won't, because, you know, after midnight, what do tourists do. They shout

630
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.410
Zsolt: like I don't know why.

631
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.560
Zsolt: but they shout sometimes they even drink.

632
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:36.810
Zsolt: And

633
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.769
Zsolt: you know, if if they have like 10 to 15 people.

634
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.340
Zsolt: It's not an ideal experience.

635
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:55.109
Zsolt: and my job is not to tell them that they can get away with it, because then they will come back the day after the day after, because it's a cool place.

636
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.790
Zsolt: Fool.

637
00:45:57.615 --> 00:46:02.860
Zsolt: Usually they get some some accompanying correcties.

638
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:09.380
Zsolt: Okay, but hopefully they will not disturb the class much, and I really hope that they just go away

639
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.280
Zsolt: last.

640
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.119
Zsolt: That's that's the disadvantage of living in a city.

641
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:22.529
Zsolt: Okay? But we have triple glazing and everything, and everything is close so hopefully it won't. You won't hear it.

642
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.810
Zsolt: Now let's see the third one.

643
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.929
Zsolt: the zenith ball

644
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:39.529
Zsolt: that's the third item

645
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.410
Zsolt: precision meets for affection.

646
00:46:49.850 --> 00:47:02.239
Zsolt: And by the way, I try to talk to them at times. But there is more than a 50% chance that after I talk to them, they become even louder, and they stay on purpose, especially if they are Mediterranean, like Spanish.

647
00:47:02.877 --> 00:47:10.229
Zsolt: It's it's especially them they. They they just stay on and and they even allow their own purpose.

648
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.279
Zsolt: Okay, then, 7, 99.

649
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:20.110
Zsolt: And by now

650
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:30.199
Zsolt: good. Now we have the third phone as well, and not much change on the website. So you will see

651
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.680
Zsolt: that you have lucks and you have done it through.

652
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:34.500
Zsolt: That's the third one.

653
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.680
Zsolt: and they are gonna be next to each other at the end.

654
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.650
Zsolt: Soul.

655
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.799
Zsolt: you'll see something like this.

656
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.129
Zsolt: yeah, some, some something like this on the website.

657
00:47:51.660 --> 00:48:04.360
Zsolt: So you don't need to focus on the right hand side, like these playlines justify content space evenly. But you see, like, the reason why it's space evenly is that the purple areas have the same width, basically.

658
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:11.330
Zsolt: So they are spaced. The these items are spaced evenly. So it's even logical.

659
00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.449
Zsolt: And then you can set up margins, and you can set up paddings and all these other things.

660
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.830
Zsolt: So it's

661
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.989
Zsolt: gonna be quite natural.

662
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:28.890
Zsolt: That's fine. Once again there is a mental hurdle of looking at the website. And how is this going to become a proper website?

663
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.179
Zsolt: Because it's really weird?

664
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.480
Zsolt: And then you will figure out that it's not that weird.

665
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.800
Zsolt: Okay, what's next?

666
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:42.660
Zsolt: Soap

667
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:46.070
Zsolt: it's time to permit and push. By the way.

668
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.380
Zsolt: good that, I reminded myself.

669
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:51.240
Zsolt: Get status.

670
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.679
Zsolt: We expect only the index of HTML file to change. And exactly, that's what happened.

671
00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:59.809
Zsolt: Get and don't

672
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.289
Zsolt: bid format minus M.

673
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.019
Zsolt: Heather. And first 2 sections.

674
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.320
Zsolt: Markov.

675
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:17.370
Zsolt: And you see the double quotes that that minus M stands for message. So this is the commit message.

676
00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.230
Zsolt: and then we have gate boots.

677
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.660
Zsolt: and this pushes to

678
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.669
Zsolt: remote to Github.

679
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.819
Zsolt: and in a minute or 2

680
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:27.350
Zsolt: you will have

681
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:32.810
Zsolt: the Github version also hosted. So you see, you can already click the link.

682
00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:43.989
Zsolt: And right now this is what's hosted. But if you wait a minute. Open the developer tools and windows control F, 5 on Mac OS. I think it's commander, or you just keep on clicking this.

683
00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.470
Zsolt: Then, sooner or later you're gonna get the proper.

684
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.980
Zsolt: the proper value

685
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.140
Zsolt: rather sooner than later. But it takes some time until

686
00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.159
Zsolt: until you get the proper value.

687
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.659
Zsolt: Okay, do you have any questions about this? So far? So this

688
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.330
Zsolt: this exercise?

689
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:21.449
Zsolt: Is it easy? Is it hard? So from a 0 to 10, then it's like absolutely obvious. And you're bored out of your not actually not bored out of your mind. But it's like like, extremely easy and 0 means. It's extremely hard. You will never learn it. Where are you? From? A scale from 0 to 10? Approximately

690
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:27.289
Zsolt: so write it in the chat. You can also send it as a private message, you can send it as a public message out to you

691
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.480
Zsolt: to solid date.

692
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.049
Zsolt: Yeah, it's not rocket science at all.

693
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.340
Zsolt: but if you see an aid, it shouldn't influence your answer. So if you're like, you don't know what is going on. And

694
00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.750
Zsolt: then then then it's a lower number, obviously

695
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.610
Zsolt: so yeah, good. So 5, 9,

696
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.240
Zsolt: and so on.

697
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:56.930
Zsolt: So usually, HTML, is not the big hurdle? 8. How do you remember all the comments?

698
00:50:57.413 --> 00:51:00.519
Zsolt: You spent 20 years in the industry.

699
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:10.299
Zsolt: and, believe me, you will remember most of it. And even then I messed up phones because I wrote phone, not phone. Is it Phones family. I think it's Fun family.

700
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.740
Zsolt: But there is a reason why I don't remember a font family.

701
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.259
Zsolt: How often do I set up the font of a website

702
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.620
Zsolt: wants.

703
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:27.520
Zsolt: So I have a project. I usually maintain, not websites like this one, but web applications that we build for 6, 7, 8 years.

704
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:29.970
Zsolt: And

705
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.720
Zsolt: I don't switch companies that often, either.

706
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.270
Zsolt: Soap.

707
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:40.019
Zsolt: I've been with the same company for the fifth year already.

708
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.910
Zsolt: It's an all-star company.

709
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.090
Zsolt: Before that

710
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.870
Zsolt: I was in another company for 7 plus years, although the that company was sold to another one.

711
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:58.149
Zsolt: and technically they were 2 separate companies. But I was in the same office with the same people, doing the exact same thing

712
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:59.870
Zsolt: 7 years.

713
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:02.729
Zsolt: and throughout those 7 years

714
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.840
Zsolt: I maintain the same application

715
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.749
Zsolt: throughout those 5 years

716
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.780
Zsolt: maintain the same application.

717
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:15.109
Zsolt: So in the last 5 years, in total, I had to do deal with like 2 applications in total on the job.

718
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:18.470
Zsolt: No, actually, there was a third one, because that was a side project.

719
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:20.850
Zsolt: So

720
00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:24.899
Zsolt: obviously, how often did I have to set up the font?

721
00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:31.130
Zsolt: Not even once, because those applications existed already that already they were not Greenfield applications.

722
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.460
Zsolt: So basically never.

723
00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:40.160
Zsolt: we don't just include a second phone to our third phone. That's why I don't remember the font family there.

724
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:42.419
Zsolt: but I can look it up.

725
00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.000
Zsolt: and I can remember other things quite easily.

726
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:51.049
Zsolt: For example, we use Flexbox like on a regular basis. Obviously, in case of flex box.

727
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.020
Zsolt: I know the comments inside out.

728
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.499
Zsolt: If you want to know the comments at least as well as I do.

729
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.939
Zsolt: then go to Flexbox, Zombies.

730
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.720
Zsolt: Google, Flexbox zombies.

731
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.919
Zsolt: I think it's 2.0 now.

732
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:13.069
Zsolt: Animations. Whatever play it, it's a game.

733
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.800
Zsolt: I'll put it in the chat.

734
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.149
Zsolt: I won't demonstrate it, because it's kind of loud, so

735
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:23.660
Zsolt: sound.

736
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:27.989
Zsolt: But it's it's it's a. It's an amazing game

737
00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:31.398
Zsolt: where you basically humped for

738
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.049
Zsolt: zombies. That's why it's called flags, box zombies.

739
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:41.880
Zsolt: and the the way how you hunt for flex book for zone. This is with Flexbox commands.

740
00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:49.949
Zsolt: So you execute flexbox comments. And and and basically, if your those comments are correct and the zombies are shot.

741
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.150
Zsolt: that's the game.

742
00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.120
Zsolt: and it's quite a good game. By the way, it's funny game, flexible zombies.

743
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.749
Zsolt: There is another one called Flexbox, 4 key.

744
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.790
Zsolt: but I think flexbook. So zombies are

745
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.059
Zsolt: better, somewhat better.

746
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:19.120
Zsolt: So let's see 7 to 9, just a little slow at times will likely get better. Once I plug into my secondary monitor, I need to get elements stick, I think. Yeah.

747
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:27.789
Zsolt: flex was command the comments, or is it a specific area? So we'll learn about Flexbox a bit later. The idea is.

748
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.649
Zsolt: let's see flags, box.

749
00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.870
Zsolt: cheat sheet.

750
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:37.010
Zsolt: Here it is. This is one of the best cheat sheets that you can. You can

751
00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.640
Zsolt: use

752
00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.690
Zsolt: Css strings.com cheat sheet. Let's post cheat.

753
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.159
Zsolt: Yeah, except I don't mind.

754
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.560
Zsolt: and I'll send you the change sheet itself.

755
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:03.530
Zsolt: and let's see what flex box is. So what flex box does is that you have a container? That's a purple stuff.

756
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.779
Zsolt: and you have the orange items, Facebook's items.

757
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.769
Zsolt: and then you can position these boxes horizontally or vertically.

758
00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.170
Zsolt: with plex rapid breaks the line

759
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.100
Zsolt: with

760
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:31.669
Zsolt: justify content. You place the inner orange content like to the start, to the end, to the center space between. Let's like this space around. It's like one unit on the left, one unit on the right for each item

761
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.960
Zsolt: space. Evenly you saw it.

762
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.889
Zsolt: You can change the order. I hardly ever do this.

763
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:44.109
Zsolt: You can grow and shrink different items with respect to what

764
00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.100
Zsolt: the zooming is.

765
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:56.000
Zsolt: Align items, positions along the cross axis, so horizontal flex boxes, position vertically for vertical flex boxes, you position horizontally.

766
00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:08.290
Zsolt: stretches the default. It stretches. All the items. Center is centers. Remember, in the menu we use baseline. This is the baseline, so that the text. The baseline of the text is the organizational principle.

767
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:15.109
Zsolt: Oh, and I had to place the flex box Css. Tricks to everyone. Not not just yeah. Now, now it's for everyone.

768
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:20.990
Zsolt: So you see that we have all these options. And this is a great cheat sheet

769
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:26.659
Zsolt: summary on Flexbox. So it's a layouting tool to position boxes

770
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.820
Zsolt: hope early.

771
00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.179
Zsolt: hopefully, it's clear like this.

772
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.080
Zsolt: I'm good.

773
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.900
Zsolt: Any other questions on Linux boxes.

774
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.210
Zsolt: or is it clear at the moment

775
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.789
Zsolt: or not? Flags books, but the HTML, css.

776
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.100
Zsolt: because, if not, we're going to move forward

777
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:52.689
Zsolt: and we'll continue with the next section cause we have quite a few more sections left.

778
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:54.730
Zsolt: so.

779
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:55.899
HashemZidan: I actually have a question.

780
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:06.629
HashemZidan: So so far, everything you've been showing us is like HTML and css, right like for example, all the changes that were made today are just HTML, Css. Or something.

781
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:07.470
Zsolt: Elsa book.

782
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:08.750
Zsolt: Yeah.

783
00:57:10.712 --> 00:57:12.320
Zsolt: this is just HTML,

784
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:17.460
Zsolt: Css. Was just what I showed you on the browser. Yes, and nothing else.

785
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:24.293
HashemZidan: Got it. Got it. Yeah. So Css is just like, you know, just the way things look like the color and and things like that.

786
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.090
Zsolt: Add animations.

787
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.140
HashemZidan: Animations.

788
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.774
Zsolt: Like

789
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:32.600
Zsolt: and show you. For example.

790
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:39.049
Zsolt: here is the plush person. No, where is it? Actually, we can check the plush site now it's now it's hosted. You see

791
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:42.089
Zsolt: animations. For example, imagine there is this image in here.

792
00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.200
Zsolt: And if I say.

793
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:45.740
Zsolt: Hi, mg.

794
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.450
Zsolt: phone over

795
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.580
Zsolt: transform

796
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.520
Zsolt: scale 1.2,

797
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.850
Zsolt: the

798
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:04.280
Zsolt: transition duration.

799
00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:08.980
Zsolt: I don't even have to explain what this means to just read the transition duration.

800
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.180
Zsolt: 0 point 2 s

801
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:15.190
Zsolt: like this.

802
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.119
Zsolt: On all images.

803
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:20.880
HashemZidan: That's interesting.

804
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.000
Zsolt: It can also do some something like transform.

805
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.380
Zsolt: Translate

806
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.170
Zsolt: 200 pixels.

807
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:33.810
Zsolt: 0

808
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.150
Zsolt: Amal

809
00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:38.739
Zsolt: moves to the right.

810
00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:48.159
Zsolt: although it's kind of complicated. Okay, let's just do like 50 pixels. Because the reason why you saw this figuring is that you move the mouse cursor on it.

811
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:59.950
Zsolt: But if I move it on the left. You see this problem that it tries to animate it. But it's not on hover over means that the most cursor is over. The element, you see, and if we approach it from the left.

812
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:06.599
Zsolt: then it's not gonna be over the element. So we have to be careful. But on the right. You see, it's it's continuous.

813
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.010
Zsolt: So this is also Css.

814
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.049
HashemZidan: Let's say you wanted to move it to the left. Would it be the same thing.

815
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:17.619
Zsolt: Almost, it says, minus 50.

816
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:22.740
HashemZidan: Oh, wow!

817
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:27.310
HashemZidan: That's pretty cool!

818
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:32.560
Zsolt: But the problem on the right. Actually, there is no problem on the right. Yeah, there is this problem on the right.

819
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.390
Zsolt: So you can do all these things.

820
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:36.840
Zsolt: or you can do like transform

821
00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:39.290
Zsolt: skew

822
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.000
Zsolt: 40 degrees.

823
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.099
Zsolt: 80 degree groups. Let's see what that means.

824
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.200
Zsolt: And you you even see this, you click on this circle.

825
01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.510
Zsolt: and then you can do anything. So

826
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.750
Zsolt: oh, that's a problem about the shame.

827
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.580
Zsolt: There is No. 360, because 360 is 0.

828
01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:18.399
Zsolt: You know we have a foreign minister like, called Anna Lena Bear Book. You know.

829
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:24.050
Zsolt: She says that that book he needs to turn C. And 360 degrees with his approach.

830
01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:31.679
Zsolt: But 360 is 0. So it's isn't the same place where he used to be so politicians and math, they just don't go hand in hand.

831
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:35.069
Zsolt: But here you have the full circle at 2 70 degrees.

832
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:44.169
Zsolt: Then you have this queuing, and it's it's like all over the place, and you have all these things, and if you want the cheat sheet, css, cheat sheet.

833
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:51.770
Zsolt: I think it's on HTML chichi.com. Yeah, exactly. HTML, css, HTML chichi.com slash css

834
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.500
Zsolt: interactive street sheet. Not a Pdf.

835
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.730
Zsolt: so I'll give you this one, too.

836
01:00:59.080 --> 01:00:59.760
Zsolt: And

837
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.200
Zsolt: if you wonder if you should remember all these things like all these rules, actually not.

838
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:13.520
Zsolt: you just look at what's possible. Do you want book schedule? Okay, let's move it to the right

839
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:15.370
Zsolt: down a bit.

840
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:28.840
Zsolt: spread it. Don't spread it. Good question. Blur it more possible. This is all ugly. But anyway, let's make it OP, like, let's increase, make it like semi transparent.

841
01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:34.319
Zsolt: But, by the way, we usually have, like a small numbers. Okay, so 5,

842
01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.270
Zsolt: 5

843
01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:39.340
Zsolt: spread is fine like 5.

844
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.800
Zsolt: Blur is not 24, but something smaller.

845
01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:46.349
Zsolt: Capacity is readable.

846
01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:57.169
Zsolt: and it should be even smaller, because now it looks like as if it was dirty. It's not a shadow, it's like dirty. So it's a generator. Is not that easy but inset. It looks better, actually

847
01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.560
Zsolt: see, it's as if it was 3 dimensional.

848
01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.999
Zsolt: And you can just play around with this gradient. There you go. What kind of gradient do you want to do?

849
01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:11.700
Zsolt: And then you specify the colors. You specify the transitions, radio, gradient, linear, gradient.

850
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.690
Zsolt: all sorts of gradients.

851
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.459
Zsolt: I don't even know how to write a linear gradient properly without help.

852
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.620
Zsolt: not this cheeky because visual studio what has built in Hub.

853
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.130
Zsolt: And then you have text shadow. That's the next thing like, move. You move the shadow on the text. That's also Css.

854
01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:36.379
Zsolt: and this transform, you see, scale.

855
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:38.990
Zsolt: rotate.

856
01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.210
Zsolt: rotate things

857
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.870
Zsolt: all the way to. Oh, actually, they have 360 degrees. Okay.

858
01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:47.159
Zsolt: 40 min there will be

859
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:48.260
Zsolt: happy

860
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.949
Zsolt: to justify survivors or costs.

861
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:54.090
Zsolt: Okay.

862
01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:55.359
Zsolt: no.

863
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:56.490
Zsolt: And those are.

864
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.020
HashemZidan: Bands right under it, right.

865
01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:08.199
Zsolt: Yeah, exactly. And then you just copy paste. With the exception of this is kind of outdated. So whenever you see this minus minus Webkit, minus minus all minus. That's opera.

866
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:11.540
Zsolt: Ms is Microsoft. You don't need any of these anymore.

867
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.370
Zsolt: You just need the last one.

868
01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:21.500
Zsolt: because because it's now browser compatibility is good enough.

869
01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:26.270
Zsolt: They're in a modern world, not not in an Internet explorer world.

870
01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.130
Zsolt: It was like long time ago, the Internet explorer word.

871
01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:39.449
Zsolt: I worked in that area. So my first front and development job was about maintaining and creating websites that were

872
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:43.149
Zsolt: that had to be viewed on Internet explorers, too.

873
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:47.610
Zsolt: That's on. That's when I named the that browser Internet explorer.

874
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.919
Zsolt: because whenever I view the website in it, it just exploded into 1,000 pieces.

875
01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.020
Zsolt: Second.

876
01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.369
Zsolt: okay, so you have all these properties. This is another option.

877
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:00.905
Zsolt: and

878
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.020
Zsolt: borders outlines all these things.

879
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.650
Zsolt: But you don't.

880
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:19.780
Zsolt: You don't need. In fact, I'm not using so I hardly ever use this cheat sheet anymore. I only use it for demonstration purposes. If you have no idea how to get started with this whole like. HTML, css, thing.

881
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:25.609
Zsolt: then it help. It's gonna help for a while. But afterwards you will learn like

882
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:31.570
Zsolt: also css, basic styling is quite easy. So for example.

883
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.550
Zsolt: Let's see.

884
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:37.900
Zsolt: let's let's give it a try.

885
01:04:38.614 --> 01:04:41.740
Zsolt: I'll I'll give you some magic, but it doesn't always work.

886
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.619
Zsolt: But actually you can trick me as well with it quite easily.

887
01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:50.999
Zsolt: Not as if you want to take me. But look at this. Suppose

888
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.769
Zsolt: suppose the following

889
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:59.199
Zsolt: Hdmr code is ebony.

890
01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.480
Zsolt: and then you base the HDMI code

891
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:09.610
Zsolt: glasses.

892
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.670
Zsolt: Total

893
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:14.660
Zsolt: HTML notes

894
01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.749
Zsolt: that you choose to style

895
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:24.940
Zsolt: and

896
01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.899
Zsolt: create a starship.

897
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.140
Zsolt: that this place

898
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:32.280
Zsolt: the 3 biffs.

899
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.559
Zsolt: you know, flat next to each other

900
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.300
Zsolt: in a flex box.

901
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.220
Zsolt: These 3 diffs

902
01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.750
Zsolt: are supposed to be

903
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.419
Zsolt: cell phone models

904
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.929
Zsolt: that the user can select

905
01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.430
Zsolt: on the buy.

906
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:06.249
Zsolt: create both the HTML and the Css. Group.

907
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.880
Zsolt: and it does everything

908
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:20.230
Zsolt: with explanations.

909
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.960
Zsolt: isn't it? Mind blowing?

910
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.500
Zsolt: Let's see the result.

911
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:30.340
Zsolt: And it misunderstood things a bit because it created the whole HDMI. Not just a section.

912
01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:42.479
Zsolt: and I told it to annotate with it. With classes. Classic was 4 models. Classic was 4, model name, description, model image price, and so on. It gave classes. These are classes.

913
01:06:42.760 --> 01:07:04.239
Zsolt: and the reason why we use these classes is that when we write Css. In that case we use these classes here, and you write a.in front of it. That's the so called class selector. It selects every single doc document node in the HTML that has this has this phone models class. In fact, there is only one. And look at this. What what is it doing? Display? Flex?

914
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.490
Zsolt: It's it's somehow I'm wondering if, like, you know, for basic HDMI, Css.

915
01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:23.909
Zsolt: it's a lot of people think that software developer jobs are obsolete because strategy can generate this. But it's not true. Actually, this is like basic work. Okay, it's not rocket science to write css, like this.

916
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:30.379
Zsolt: Why, you studied it. It is rocket science, obviously to remember some of these things. But

917
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.670
Zsolt: the sale?

918
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:32.660
Zsolt: No.

919
01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.130
Zsolt: but

920
01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.500
Zsolt: let's see.

921
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.540
Zsolt: let's do.

922
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:41.480
Zsolt: Let's do a demonstration code. Panda dial.

923
01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:46.080
Zsolt: and I won't go to visual studio code. I just create a code back

924
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:50.780
Zsolt: and let me copy it

925
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:59.709
Zsolt: over from Chat. Jbd, so quote numbers in a way that you just copy whatever is inside the body. You don't need the whole whole HTML markup.

926
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.670
Zsolt: So there you go. You have the section. Everything is displayed just like before

927
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:12.240
Zsolt: then? No.

928
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.209
Zsolt: the Css part.

929
01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:17.979
Zsolt: So I copy the Css

930
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:20.729
Zsolt: bureaucr.

931
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:25.550
Zsolt: And yeah.

932
01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:32.900
Zsolt: it's kind of okay for that purpose. Buttons are blue.

933
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.310
Zsolt: prices are blue.

934
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.470
Zsolt: and then

935
01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.120
Zsolt: like

936
01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:46.299
Zsolt: move the prices price and the buy. Now

937
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.620
Zsolt: buttons next to each other.

938
01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.910
Zsolt: HTML stays the same.

939
01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:04.190
Zsolt: No, it doesn't, because, it added the diff. It's in the tutorial as well. I added the diff, too.

940
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.910
Zsolt: so it seems like now they are next to each other. Right?

941
01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:15.689
Zsolt: And let let me copy the HTML. Let me copy the Css.

942
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.180
Zsolt: So body section.

943
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.349
Zsolt: So I'll add the HTML.

944
01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:26.450
Zsolt: Based.

945
01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.239
Zsolt: and I'll also add the Css.

946
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.120
Zsolt: The Updated Css.

947
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:48.910
Zsolt: Now the price and the buy now, button are next to each other exactly.

948
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.120
Zsolt: Then

949
01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.469
Zsolt: keep the exact same HD amount.

950
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.880
Zsolt: Make the

951
01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:06.280
Zsolt: website

952
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.700
Zsolt: more colorful.

953
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:16.460
Zsolt: but

954
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:20.090
Zsolt: creating a luxury

955
01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.349
Zsolt: locals for you

956
01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:26.930
Zsolt: and

957
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:31.740
Zsolt: return

958
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.830
Zsolt: the

959
01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.930
Zsolt: we'll define Css.

960
01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.130
Zsolt: And now we'll see.

961
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:42.749
Zsolt: It seems like it's doing some colors.

962
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:49.289
Zsolt: And it explained what it did.

963
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540
Zsolt: So

964
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.129
Zsolt: we changed a Css

965
01:11:01.893 --> 01:11:06.240
Zsolt: is that luxury luxurious? It doesn't look like luxurious.

966
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:10.500
Zsolt: What's on everything?

967
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.029
Zsolt: Come on. This is far from

968
01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:22.040
Zsolt: being luxurious.

969
01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:24.900
Zsolt: Get inspired

970
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:27.889
Zsolt: by the colors.

971
01:11:28.857 --> 01:11:31.190
Zsolt: Our phone, Samos.

972
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.700
Zsolt: Jps lotus

973
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.730
Zsolt: from 1986,

974
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.539
Zsolt: just saying, like

975
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.640
Zsolt: Samuel, locals, 1986

976
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.389
Zsolt: feels like this.

977
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:54.240
Zsolt: gold and black.

978
01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.410
Zsolt: Okay.

979
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.149
Zsolt: long time ago, I know.

980
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.859
Zsolt: And now let's see what it does.

981
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.150
Zsolt: Well, it did the job.

982
01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.190
Zsolt: I didn't say it's black and gold, right?

983
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:26.059
Zsolt: Kind of got inspired by the correct correct colors.

984
01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.050
Zsolt: So it's

985
01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:42.350
Zsolt: look at the question. Come on. This is far from being. Luxury is getting inspired by the color, since it sent us Jps loaders from 1986, and it found this similar colors like it's, it's not not that cold.

986
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:48.539
Zsolt: not that type of goal, but it understood what what it had to do. Now

987
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:53.940
Zsolt: think about. Think about what else you can. You can. You can do

988
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.500
Zsolt: as a complete beginner.

989
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:02.300
Zsolt: So as soon as you understand where to put the issue and where to put the Css. And where to modify things.

990
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:05.289
Zsolt: then it's gonna be all fine.

991
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.089
Zsolt: But the problem is that

992
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.382
Zsolt: that you still cannot use this tool like perfectly, because the problem is that

993
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:18.550
Zsolt: you cannot protect yourself from pre plagiarism

994
01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.020
Zsolt: because the tool cannot give you the sources.

995
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:31.770
Zsolt: Sometimes it just steal stuff straight away from existing websites.

996
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.759
Zsolt: And that's that's kind of a big problem, right?

997
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.030
Zsolt: That you never know

998
01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:39.070
Zsolt: the original source.

999
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:43.510
Zsolt: And that's a relatively big difficulty with Chat. Gpd.

1000
01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:48.429
Zsolt: so even though it looks exciting in reality, it's not that exciting.

1001
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:53.349
Zsolt: because you still need to do the job yourself.

1002
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.260
Zsolt: That's something.

1003
01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:01.360
Zsolt: Okay, getting back to the tutorial. We need to make some some progress in the HTML.

1004
01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:05.020
Zsolt: So

1005
01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:20.480
Zsolt: then we have the next sections. There is nothing new in here. So it's like we have heading to a paragraph and image battery life, safety redefined normal. Where plus AI, your phone is your assistant and modular broken screen. No problem.

1006
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:25.530
Zsolt: I just copy. Paste this inside so that we don't waste much time.

1007
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.629
Zsolt: There's the next section.

1008
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:34.150
Zsolt: and I'll place it for now, actually, it's including the section. So it's the next section is. So

1009
01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.719
Zsolt: third section, is it? But yeah, it's a third section

1010
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:41.480
Zsolt: and save.

1011
01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.700
Zsolt: So they've

1012
01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.760
Zsolt: funny for our battery life.

1013
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.440
Zsolt: but it has this kind of weirdness. Right?

1014
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:52.910
Zsolt: Informative. What is this

1015
01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:00.710
Zsolt: world better?

1016
01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:06.889
Zsolt: I don't know. I'm I'm not used to this type of paragraph formatting.

1017
01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.370
Zsolt: but an event

1018
01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.650
Zsolt: with some with some extra care

1019
01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.050
Zsolt: we can take care of the

1020
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:17.250
Zsolt: paragraph port.

1021
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.089
Zsolt: and then you see that we have yet another section in here

1022
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:29.839
Zsolt: and not in the deployed version, because there we haven't committed push that

1023
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:34.130
Zsolt: but locally, you see, battery life, safety plus AI modular.

1024
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:36.539
Zsolt: So that's another one.

1025
01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:39.830
Zsolt: and then what else do we have?

1026
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.280
Zsolt: So

1027
01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:47.420
Zsolt: you have a bottom banner, a call to Action Section.

1028
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.369
Zsolt: Did I miss something? I think he has the

1029
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:59.440
Zsolt: tagline. There is a tagline section. I forgot to add the Tagline section. It's in between the

1030
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:05.600
Zsolt: 2 sections. So just another heading to when there's another paragraph.

1031
01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.670
Zsolt: Why is it there?

1032
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:11.530
Zsolt: Because so we had this image somewhere.

1033
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:13.020
Zsolt: this image.

1034
01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.910
Zsolt: and there was a tagline in here.

1035
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.370
Zsolt: So that's that's a tagline that we are missing.

1036
01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.989
Zsolt: And then this is gonna be the call to Action board.

1037
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:26.420
Zsolt: soul.

1038
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:30.189
Zsolt: We will create the call to action. It's another section

1039
01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.150
Zsolt: with,

1040
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.980
Zsolt: Some comment.

1041
01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.070
Zsolt: and I'm heading to flagship Posh and so on.

1042
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.839
Zsolt: That's the fifth section.

1043
01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:46.790
Zsolt: these green stuff. So less than sign

1044
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:54.009
Zsolt: exclamation mark minus minus you write comments and and HTML ignores it. This is just for maintenance purposes.

1045
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:55.970
Zsolt: for maintainability purposes.

1046
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.580
Zsolt: And I'm having 2

1047
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.610
Zsolt: flagship flush

1048
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.410
Zsolt: and then paragraph.

1049
01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.850
Zsolt: And then what else?

1050
01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.000
Zsolt: Button by now.

1051
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:16.000
Zsolt: Yeah.

1052
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.750
Zsolt: And then you have this bottom section. We're going to decorate it with images and everything.

1053
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:25.450
Zsolt: And then the slash main. It's done.

1054
01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.660
Zsolt: Then comes the full dirt.

1055
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.929
Zsolt: So and the footer.

1056
01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.960
Zsolt: we basically repeat what was in the header. So we are the navigational element.

1057
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:38.610
Zsolt: What will style them as footer links

1058
01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.319
Zsolt: on order list

1059
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:43.400
Zsolt: inside and all those you have 5 list items.

1060
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.759
Zsolt: But remember that inside the list items

1061
01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.489
Zsolt: you have anchors

1062
01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:51.740
Zsolt: where the H. Of attribute is a hash mark.

1063
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.940
Zsolt: and you do it 5 times

1064
01:17:57.690 --> 01:18:05.759
Zsolt: if you don't know how to generate this, don't worry. You just type these things this time so you could have done it like this. Like all I have

1065
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:07.290
Zsolt: 8. Them

1066
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:18.440
Zsolt: add the hash mark, and then you write the text and then go to the next line, Li, tab a tab. You add the hash mark here you type the text, and so on.

1067
01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:24.410
Zsolt: It's you could save like 10 s with or 20 s with the auto generate.

1068
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:29.180
Zsolt: So don't worry about not being able to generate this.

1069
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.129
Zsolt: So under the boom

1070
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.549
Zsolt: phone's features, virtual contact

1071
01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:47.210
Zsolt: welcome.

1072
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.999
Zsolt: And I'll let the first one as a bot.

1073
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:54.600
Zsolt: not as if it was like important. It's just we stay on the same page.

1074
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:57.610
Zsolt: and with that we're finished

1075
01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.520
Zsolt: the HTML port.

1076
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.160
Zsolt: So get status

1077
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:03.909
Zsolt: with a dog

1078
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.280
Zsolt: mid comment time, son.

1079
01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.029
Zsolt: No

1080
01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.250
Zsolt: home website, markup.

1081
01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.260
Zsolt: We'll go off

1082
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:18.340
Zsolt: with fish.

1083
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:27.930
Zsolt: So you see, once again, these like, get messages if you make like one to one to 10 comets a day for the next

1084
01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.210
Zsolt: 20 years.

1085
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:35.660
Zsolt: No, maybe like 10 years or 8, because I didn't always use it myself, either.

1086
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:39.320
Zsolt: Then maybe you will not have to think at all.

1087
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.929
Zsolt: So you know the competence model. Right?

1088
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.100
Zsolt: So

1089
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:47.050
Zsolt: phone buttons.

1090
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:49.760
Zsolt: mobile.

1091
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:53.460
Zsolt: unconscious incompetence, it starts with unconscious incompetence.

1092
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.510
Zsolt: Yeah, that's it.

1093
01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.200
Zsolt: So unconscious incompetence is when you don't know when you don't. You don't know what you don't know.

1094
01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:09.550
Zsolt: It's like my first ever go kart race.

1095
01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.350
Zsolt: I thought that that was amazing.

1096
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:18.900
Zsolt: because I qualified. Fourth out of 12 we had like 12 drivers, and I qualified. Fourth.

1097
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:27.509
Zsolt: it turned out that I just got lucky, and it I just got like a one tenth of a second or something. I thought that I had a chance of winning.

1098
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:36.969
Zsolt: And then the standing start came, and everyone just went past me, and then they pushed me aside a bit because they knew how to how to like race.

1099
01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:42.550
Zsolt: And after this, the first corner, I was like ninth or something.

1100
01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:53.260
Zsolt: But I was after I was 19 away that 2 drivers crashed out. So I should. I was effectively 11 from position 4.

1101
01:20:53.330 --> 01:21:02.069
Zsolt: I didn't know what they I didn't even know what I didn't know. Same thing with some of you were H on HTML, Css. Or Chpd. For that matter.

1102
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.079
Zsolt: Then you come to class.

1103
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:16.770
Zsolt: and you understand what you don't know. For example, by listening to these sessions, and then you conclude that oh, I would not be able to do it myself without a lot of practice.

1104
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.819
Zsolt: So this unconscious incompetence becomes conscious incompetence.

1105
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.800
Zsolt: So now you know what you don't know.

1106
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.240
Zsolt: and then you study and practice a lot

1107
01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.789
Zsolt: and create your projects, and then you finish your projects, and you get graded

1108
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:37.050
Zsolt: and incompetence becomes competence.

1109
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:42.890
Zsolt: So essentially, you're not like a politician anymore. It actually can get something done.

1110
01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:45.010
Zsolt: So conscious competence.

1111
01:21:46.019 --> 01:21:46.509
Zsolt: and

1112
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.429
Zsolt: Then the difference between you and me

1113
01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:54.529
Zsolt: in terms of writing css, or HTML,

1114
01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:55.950
Zsolt: is that

1115
01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:00.189
Zsolt: you know how to write HTML and css, now.

1116
01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:02.940
Zsolt: but you still have to think about it.

1117
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:11.370
Zsolt: And the next step. And and this is where I told you that it's the next 10 years, or 5 years or 20 years, or whatever

1118
01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:12.684
Zsolt: that

1119
01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.760
Zsolt: conscious competence

1120
01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:21.290
Zsolt: becomes unconscious competence. It's like you just know it. You don't even have to think about it

1121
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.430
Zsolt: like speaking a language.

1122
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.369
Zsolt: I have a very hard time

1123
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.870
Zsolt: like recognizing

1124
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:36.290
Zsolt: even Japanese letters.

1125
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.090
Zsolt: I know that.

1126
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:45.570
Zsolt: For example, let's say online paid.

1127
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:49.469
Zsolt: Let's see JS. payne.com.

1128
01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:54.940
Zsolt: Oh, that's Microsoft paint amazing. I know that. For example, if you have something like this.

1129
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.570
Zsolt: that's the

1130
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.400
Zsolt: syllable car.

1131
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.129
Zsolt: you don't come off.

1132
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:08.960
Zsolt: Oh, let's see?

1133
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.710
Zsolt: Yeah, it was like a different different accent. But it's basically you recognize, right? This

1134
01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.060
Zsolt: horizontal this way and then this.

1135
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.490
Zsolt: So

1136
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.690
Zsolt: yeah.

1137
01:23:24.465 --> 01:23:25.050
Zsolt: the

1138
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:34.849
Zsolt: the thing is that I could read a couple of words, and I could speak a couple of sentences, because, I was kind of involved in anima

1139
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.929
Zsolt: or anime, or whatever.

1140
01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:38.030
Zsolt: like

1141
01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:40.039
Zsolt: once again 20 years ago.

1142
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.830
Zsolt: But

1143
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:49.060
Zsolt: my knowledge is like so faded that if I had to have to interpret any Japanese text even to pronounce it.

1144
01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.419
Zsolt: It would take me quite a while.

1145
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.130
Zsolt: Same thing with the HDMI. Css.

1146
01:23:56.390 --> 01:24:00.750
Zsolt: So you learn it. You have to think about it, and one day you won't have to think about it anymore.

1147
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:02.610
Zsolt: And that's

1148
01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:07.330
Zsolt: by the way, that's not necessarily boot camp territory. It may be after the boot camp as well.

1149
01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.750
Zsolt: because it's continuous practice.

1150
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.786
Zsolt: Alright, then.

1151
01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:20.169
Zsolt: I think that, given that, we're done with HTML,

1152
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:24.529
Zsolt: the next thing we are gonna do. And it's not gonna be today

1153
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:27.109
Zsolt: there is this tool called Kamba.

1154
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:30.060
Zsolt: So register an account on Combo.

1155
01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.980
Zsolt: and then you'll be able to create like image images like this one.

1156
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:41.515
Zsolt: So let's create some, some straightforward like

1157
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:45.119
Zsolt: images. Just as an example. So, for example.

1158
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.700
Zsolt: home

1159
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.610
Zsolt: duplicate this image somehow

1160
01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:55.720
Zsolt: and may maybe I'll just create a new one. So file

1161
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:58.090
Zsolt: create new design.

1162
01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:00.350
Zsolt: custom, size.

1163
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.899
Zsolt: and it's the same like with

1164
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:05.140
Zsolt: 300 height, 500.

1165
01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:10.470
Zsolt: So here is the custom, size image that you can see?

1166
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.230
Zsolt: And let's say it's a phone model

1167
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:16.749
Zsolt: more than 4.

1168
01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.710
Zsolt: And they go to photos.

1169
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:23.130
Zsolt: modern form.

1170
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:28.610
Zsolt: And there you go. This is like some sort of a modern phone.

1171
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:37.450
Zsolt: huh?

1172
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:40.329
Zsolt: And then you go like edit portal.

1173
01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.500
Zsolt: And let's see, there it will go first.

1174
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.809
Zsolt: You can do quite a lot of things with the photo itself

1175
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Zsolt: slow.

1176
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.510
Zsolt: So

1177
01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.360
Zsolt: magic edit

1178
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.730
Zsolt: brush over the area area to edit.

1179
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:17.059
Zsolt: Then I'm like, describe it.

1180
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:21.019
Zsolt: They need the brushed.

1181
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:22.279
Zsolt: There we go.

1182
01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.310
Zsolt: Only one.

1183
01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.210
Zsolt: Make the background

1184
01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:27.840
Zsolt: transparent.

1185
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.390
Zsolt: Generate.

1186
01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.549
Zsolt: This is Combo.

1187
01:26:37.530 --> 01:26:38.759
Zsolt: Take some time.

1188
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:46.720
Zsolt: but it has some understanding problems, so it's not like judging it. There you go.

1189
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:49.369
Zsolt: It deleted the frame.

1190
01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:51.589
Zsolt: Look up the rest.

1191
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.470
Zsolt: Okay, so that's magic at it. You see that? It's not that good

1192
01:26:55.970 --> 01:27:00.730
Zsolt: but magic eraser. That's actually better. Brush size 20.

1193
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.449
Zsolt: I go on the race.

1194
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:09.039
Zsolt: We don't even need to specify this. Or can we do a larger brush brush size, maybe.

1195
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:13.050
Zsolt: Oh, yeah. And the AI tool is already doing this. Okay?

1196
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.830
Zsolt: And it takes some time.

1197
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.519
Zsolt: Yeah, just delete everything. You.

1198
01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.200
Zsolt: I fully delete everything

1199
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:28.659
Zsolt: I just want to keep the left

1200
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:34.920
Zsolt: to understand.

1201
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:41.450
Zsolt: although my hopes are going to be shattered because AI doesn't understand anything

1202
01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:47.679
Zsolt: like I mean, you know, Deletion, it doesn't mean that you keep the shades, or whatever it just delete.

1203
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:56.999
Zsolt: Anyway, sometimes you need to debate quite a lot with these AI tools.

1204
01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:05.920
Zsolt: Okay.

1205
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.010
Zsolt: now.

1206
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:08.810
Zsolt: close enough.

1207
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.649
Zsolt: Let's do it this way.

1208
01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.570
Zsolt: And now you have this form

1209
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:14.639
Zsolt: and then bg, remover.

1210
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:25.040
Zsolt: I hope it doesn't keep. Yeah, exactly. You see, it removed the right hand side finally.

1211
01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.010
Zsolt: So we have a phone image.

1212
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:35.419
Zsolt: You have a one month trial on Combo. By the way, that's not paid

1213
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.490
Zsolt: per account that you created.

1214
01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.739
Zsolt: But you didn't hear it for me.

1215
01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.410
Zsolt: Okay.

1216
01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:47.660
Zsolt: actually, I'm a paid subscriber of combo because I use it for business

1217
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.245
Zsolt: then

1218
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:58.259
Zsolt: and but I don't have time to deal with Photoshop. So

1219
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.929
Zsolt: I used to work with Photoshop in the past.

1220
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:05.070
Zsolt: But it's like, I really don't have time for it.

1221
01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:12.990
Zsolt: The Photoshop gives you so slightly better quality and more customizability options.

1222
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:17.760
Zsolt: But this is better.

1223
01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.309
Zsolt: This is better in a sense that for simple tasks like this.

1224
01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.544
Zsolt: and then let's see some

1225
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:26.590
Zsolt: mountains.

1226
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:33.970
Zsolt: Okay, some Swiss phone or something. Right?

1227
01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.800
Zsolt: Let's see, here is a beak.

1228
01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.949
Zsolt: We keep this one

1229
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:43.450
Zsolt: now right? Click.

1230
01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.840
Zsolt: set images, background.

1231
01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.630
Zsolt: Unfortunately, we cannot see the peak.

1232
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:57.740
Zsolt: but if you modify things a bit.

1233
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:06.169
Zsolt: then we will see the peak as well.

1234
01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:15.630
Zsolt: Okay. And by the way, you can also rotate and do these things like quite easily.

1235
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:21.950
Zsolt: This is a real tool. We don't use comma for bio framing. By the way, it's different.

1236
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:26.250
Zsolt: But we use Kamba for like creating these images, and they look quite good.

1237
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.266
Zsolt: And then, let's see, do we have

1238
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:34.700
Zsolt: gone off?

1239
01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:42.659
Zsolt: Yeah, we do. We have a Gandalf, and the Gandalf is fighting with the demons of the top of the mountain. Yeah, we can do that.

1240
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.590
Zsolt: That's not the real Gandalf, though.

1241
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.340
Zsolt: Okay.

1242
01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.010
Zsolt: so now you see

1243
01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:55.880
Zsolt: what does

1244
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:58.510
Zsolt: going on, and what options we have.

1245
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:01.670
Zsolt: and the

1246
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:05.810
Zsolt: and elements

1247
01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:09.379
Zsolt: you can add, for example, this decoration

1248
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.189
Zsolt: for the summit. There you go.

1249
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.929
Zsolt: and then you have this

1250
01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:23.830
Zsolt: or

1251
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.370
Zsolt: whatever

1252
01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.160
Zsolt: I can find a pair

1253
01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:42.830
Zsolt: edit photo. Bg, remover. And then you just keep the bear.

1254
01:31:56.110 --> 01:32:01.789
Zsolt: You know the pay how it's and it enters more to accomplish that toasty guy, you know.

1255
01:32:03.585 --> 01:32:04.420
Zsolt: Or

1256
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:05.930
Zsolt: even better.

1257
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.500
Zsolt: there is this other bar code.

1258
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:11.040
Zsolt: Remove the background.

1259
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.980
Zsolt: Okay, I'll debate with the the

1260
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:19.940
Zsolt: AI tool a bit

1261
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:21.810
Zsolt: magic edit.

1262
01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:26.970
Zsolt: and it's like whole image.

1263
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.260
Zsolt: Describe it.

1264
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:32.490
Zsolt: If it's a banner.

1265
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:34.459
Zsolt: remove the 3.

1266
01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:38.940
Zsolt: It cannot be easier than this. Right?

1267
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:52.899
Zsolt: That's not what I meant.

1268
01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.930
Zsolt: It doesn't recognize the bear. That's the problem.

1269
01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:06.030
Zsolt: Yeah, not good.

1270
01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:11.499
Zsolt: Then we won't have a backup. But you got got the idea. You can do all these things.

1271
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.189
Zsolt: They're on the phone. There you go. It works.

1272
01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.400
Zsolt: Okay.

1273
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:40.760
Zsolt: soaked.

1274
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:42.889
Zsolt: You have quite a lot of options.

1275
01:33:44.146 --> 01:33:45.650
Zsolt: You have some elements.

1276
01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:48.040
Zsolt: For example, if you have a

1277
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:52.590
Zsolt: price tag.

1278
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:56.620
Zsolt: there you go.

1279
01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.990
Zsolt: We rotate. It somehow

1280
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.800
Zsolt: is difficult, because a phone is kind of large.

1281
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:26.170
Zsolt: What which shift you can change. This dimension!

1282
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:31.509
Zsolt: No, actually, let's keep the dimensions more or less

1283
01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.130
Zsolt: and center it.

1284
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:37.040
Zsolt: That price tag doesn't look good anyway.

1285
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:41.250
Zsolt: this one is not better.

1286
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.090
Zsolt: not not good either.

1287
01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.110
Zsolt: I'm bum

1288
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.539
Zsolt: you place this badge in here.

1289
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:58.319
Zsolt: Then you add some text like

1290
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.060
Zsolt: gold

1291
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:06.020
Zsolt: this.

1292
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:24.200
Zsolt: and this way you make a luxury. Phones right cheap like.

1293
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:25.560
Zsolt: see?

1294
01:35:26.676 --> 01:35:30.650
Zsolt: Not cheap like dollar amount cheap, but rather

1295
01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.119
Zsolt: the design.

1296
01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.929
Zsolt: Let's make this somewhat lighter. Yeah.

1297
01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:49.499
Zsolt: yeah, it's design wise. We can make a lot of changes, because exactly what you see, I'm just.

1298
01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:53.189
Zsolt: I'm just demonstrating the capabilities of the tool.

1299
01:35:53.970 --> 01:35:56.889
Zsolt: and you can do surprising things with it.

1300
01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:00.299
Zsolt: You can upload your own images as well

1301
01:36:03.810 --> 01:36:06.569
Zsolt: and do quite a lot of things in general.

1302
01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.950
Zsolt: It can also generate images. Okay, so with that, if you prefer

1303
01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:16.740
Zsolt: done long.

1304
01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:21.799
Zsolt: You can generate a couple of images for phones like this.

1305
01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:25.050
Zsolt: preferably better than this one.

1306
01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:30.440
Zsolt: So that that's an option. You can just try out Combo, and then then you'll see how how this works.

1307
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:38.440
Zsolt: And with that, given that we have this. We have the Saturday session, and we have today's session as well, and stop screen sharing.

1308
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:40.859
Zsolt: and I'll also stop recording.

1309
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:49.450
Zsolt: So we'll continue on Saturday. Don't forget the Saturday session. Usual time, I know, like

1310
01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:53.570
Zsolt: this is like week 2. So not that usual. Yet for some of you.

1311
01:36:54.048 --> 01:36:58.839
Zsolt: I will be there either way. So, regardless of how you are notified.

1312
01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.195
Zsolt: So.

1313
01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:13.489
Zsolt: this was week 2, session, 2, not week, 3, session one. This is still week, 2, session 2. So we're joining Saturday session. And today's session into one. So we're finishing a bit earlier.

1314
01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.530
Zsolt: and enjoy your evening. Continue on Saturday. Have a good one, bye.
